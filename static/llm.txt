Hooks are Gas Town's **durability primitive**. A hook is a persistent attachment point where work state is stored in a way that survives crashes, restarts, handoffs, context compaction, and even machine failures. Hooks are what make Gas Town agents self-propelling -- an agent always knows what to do by checking its hook.

**Gates** are synchronization points in Gas Town workflows. When a molecule step needs to wait for an external condition -- a CI pipeline finishing, a human approving a change, or a timer elapsing -- it parks on a gate. The gate holds the workflow until the condition is met, then releases it to continue.

A **Rig** is Gas Town's project container. Each rig wraps a git repository with the full agent infrastructure needed to manage, develop, and merge code. Rigs are the physical structure of a Gas Town workspace -- every project you manage with Gas Town becomes a rig.

---

## The MEOW Stack
> /docs/concepts/meow-stack

The MEOW Stack is Gas Town's layered abstraction model for organizing work, from atomic Beads to reusable Formulas.

The **MEOW Stack** (Molecules, Epics, Orchestration, Workflows) is Gas Town's layered abstraction model for organizing and executing work. Each layer builds on the one below it, creating a composable system that scales from a single task to an entire project buildout.

---

## GUPP & NDI
> /docs/concepts/gupp

The Gas Town Universal Propulsion Principle (GUPP) and Nondeterministic Idempotence (NDI) are the core design principles that make Gas Town reliable at scale.

Two foundational principles govern how Gas Town handles the inherent chaos of multi-agent AI coordination: the **Gas Town Universal Propulsion Principle (GUPP)** and **Nondeterministic Idempotence (NDI)**.

---

## Wisps (Ephemeral Sub-Beads)
> /docs/concepts/wisps

Wisps are lightweight, ephemeral sub-beads that track individual steps within a molecule. They provide granular progress visibility without cluttering the persistent issue database.

**Wisps** are lightweight tracking units that represent individual steps within a [molecule](molecules.md). Each step in a molecule's workflow is tracked as a wisp -- an ephemeral sub-bead that records progress, state transitions, and completion without persisting to the main issue database.

---

## Session Cycling
> /docs/concepts/session-cycling

Session cycling is Gas Town's mechanism for refreshing an agent's context window without losing work. When an agent's context fills up, it hands off to a fresh session that resumes from where it left off.

**Session cycling** is Gas Town's mechanism for refreshing an agent's context window without losing work. When a session fills its context or finishes a logical chunk, it creates a handoff and a fresh session picks up where it left off.

**Minimal Mode** lets you use Gas Town's persistence and tracking features without requiring Tmux or the full agent hierarchy. You manually spawn agents and manage work, while Gas Town provides hooks, beads, and convoy tracking. This is ideal for getting started, running on limited resources, or when you prefer hands-on control.

---

## Manual Convoy Workflow

The **Manual Convoy Workflow** gives you direct control over work distribution while still using Gas Town's convoy tracking, merge queue, and agent infrastructure. Unlike the Mayor Workflow (where the Mayor decides assignments), you create the convoy, add issues, and sling them individually to specific rigs or agents.

---

The **Formula Workflow** uses predefined TOML templates to orchestrate structured, repeatable processes. Instead of describing work in free-form text, you select a formula that defines the exact steps, run it with variables, and let Gas Town execute the workflow. This is ideal for standardized processes like releases, design explorations, and audits.

---

## Code Review Workflow
> /docs/workflows/code-review

Gas Town provides a powerful **parallel code review** system using the `code-review` convoy formula. Instead of a single reviewer reading through a PR, Gas Town spawns multiple specialized reviewer polecats -- each examining the code from a different perspective -- then synthesizes their findings into a unified, prioritized review.

---

## Crew Collaboration
> /docs/workflows/crew-collaboration

Patterns for humans working alongside AI agents in crew workspaces -- reviewing polecat output, feeding guzzoline, and maintaining code quality while the fleet runs.

This workflow describes how human developers in [Crew workspaces](../agents/crew.md) work alongside AI polecats. The core pattern: humans produce **guzzoline** (specifications, designs, reviews) and polecats consume it (implementation, testing, fixes).

Gas Town provides granular control over the system lifecycle -- from starting the entire fleet to managing individual agents and rigs. Understanding the distinction between **pause** (`gt down`) and **shutdown** (`gt shutdown`) is critical: pausing preserves worktrees and state for fast restart, while shutdown cleans up resources.

---

Gas Town's escalation system provides priority-routed alerts that flow upward through the supervision hierarchy. When an agent encounters a problem it cannot resolve, it creates an escalation that routes to the appropriate handler based on severity. This ensures critical issues reach the human operator quickly while low-severity problems are tracked without interruption.
