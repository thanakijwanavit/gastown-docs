Welcome to the Gas Town blog. This is where we share updates about Gas Town, tips for running multi-agent workflows, architecture deep dives, and practical guides for scaling AI-assisted development.

## What is Gas Town?

Gas Town is a multi-agent orchestration system that coordinates fleets of AI coding agents working on your projects simultaneously. Built on top of Claude Code (with support for other runtimes), it scales from a single agent to 20-30 concurrent workers — all managed through the `gt` CLI.

The name comes from the oil refinery citadel in Mad Max: Fury Road, reflecting the system's industrial approach to coordinating autonomous agents at scale.

## Key Ideas

Gas Town is built around a few core principles that set it apart from ad-hoc multi-agent setups:

- **Supervisor trees** — Agents monitor each other in a hierarchy (Mayor → Deacon → Witness → Polecats), so failures are detected and recovered automatically.
- **Git-backed persistence** — All work state lives in git or git-adjacent storage. Context survives crashes, restarts, and session cycling.
- **Hook-driven propulsion** — When an agent finds work on its hook, it executes immediately. No confirmation step, no waiting for approval. This is what makes Gas Town fast.
- **Serialized merges** — The Refinery merge queue ensures that parallel agent work lands cleanly on main, one commit at a time.
