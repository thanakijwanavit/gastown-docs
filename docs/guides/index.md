# Guides

This section provides in-depth guides for using Gas Town effectively, understanding its design philosophy, and getting the most out of multi-agent AI development.

## Sections

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Usage Guide](usage-guide.md) | Comprehensive walkthrough for day-to-day Gas Town usage |
| [The 8 Stages of AI Coding](eight-stages.md) | Understanding where Gas Town fits in the AI coding maturity model |
| [Multi-Runtime Support](multi-runtime.md) | Using Gas Town with Claude, Gemini, Codex, Cursor, and more |
| [Cost Management](cost-management.md) | Monitoring and optimizing token spend |
| [Background & Philosophy](philosophy.md) | Why Gas Town exists, its history, and design philosophy |
| [Architecture Guide](architecture.md) | Comprehensive tour of Gas Town's multi-agent architecture |
| [Glossary](glossary.md) | Complete terminology reference for all Gas Town concepts |

## Who Are These Guides For?

Gas Town is a power tool. These guides assume you are:

- Comfortable with the command line and git
- Already using AI coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, etc.)
- Ready to coordinate **multiple** agents working in parallel
- Willing to invest time learning a new operational model

If you are new to AI-assisted coding, start with a single agent (Stage 5-6 in the [8 Stages model](eight-stages.md)) before adopting Gas Town.

## Reading Order

For new Gas Town users, we recommend this reading order:

1. **[The 8 Stages of AI Coding](eight-stages.md)** -- Understand where Gas Town fits and whether you are ready for it
2. **[Background & Philosophy](philosophy.md)** -- Understand why Gas Town exists and the mental model behind it
3. **[Architecture Guide](architecture.md)** -- Understand how the agents, rigs, and pipelines fit together
4. **[Usage Guide](usage-guide.md)** -- Learn the day-to-day workflows and commands
5. **[Multi-Runtime Support](multi-runtime.md)** -- If you use agents other than Claude Code
6. **[Cost Management](cost-management.md)** -- Essential for anyone running at scale
